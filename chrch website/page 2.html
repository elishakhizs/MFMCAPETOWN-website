    <h1>About MFM</h1>
<p>MFM Ministries is a full gospel ministry devoted to the Revival of Apostolic Signs,Holy Ghost fireworks and the unlimited demonstration of the power of God to deliver to the uttermost.<br><br>

Absolute holiness within and without as the greatest spiritual insecticide and a pre-requisite for Heaven is taught openly. MFM is a do-it-yourself Gospel ministry where your hands are trained to wage war and your fingers to do battle.<br><br>

At MFM, aggressive prayer is considered as an aid to spiritual focus and a check against being overwhelmed by the flesh. At MFM Prayer City, prayer goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, non-stop.<br><br></p>
<h3 style="color: purple;">MISSION + VISION</h3>
<ul class="list"><p class ="listB">
    <li>To propagate the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ all over the world</li><br><br>
    <li>To promote the revival of Apostolic signs, wonders and miracles</li><br><br>
    <li>To bring together children of God who are lost in dead churches</li><br><br>
<li>To train believers in the art and science of spiritual warfare; thus making them an aggressive and victorious army for the Lord</li><br><br>
    <li>To train believers to receive Holy Ghost baptism and fire as well as a daily walk and relationship with the Holy Spirit</li><br><br>
    <li>To turn the joy of our enemies to sorrow. That is why we would always have a Deliverance ministry wherever we are. If you do not believe in deliverance, you are not supposed to be in MFM</li><br><br>
    <li>To build an aggressive end-time army for the Lord. MFM is an end-time church where we build an aggressive end-time army for the Lord</li><br>
    <br><p><strong>What is an end-time church?</strong> An end-time church is a church where a sinner enters with two options: he either repents or does not come back, contrary to the present day church where sinners are comfortable and find things so easy and convenient.</p>
    <li>To deliver those who have become slaves to pastors, prophets and apostles</li><br><br>
    <li>To build up heavenly-bound and aggressive Christians. The priority in MFM is for people to make heaven. It is not a worldly Church</li><br><br>
    <li>To build up prayer eagles</li><br><br>
    <li>To purify the Pentecostal dirtiness of this age</li><br><br>
